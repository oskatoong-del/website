    <strong>Maozedong rule </strong>h6 before 1946: Being created during the messy split
    of the qing dynasty, in july 1921 the ccp was created in shanghai. They took control
    of jiangxi province before moving north to yan'an. This was after the nationalists 
    destroyed the old base. Being at yan'an , the communists then helped the nationalists fight
    the japanese before controlling all of Manchuria north of the Songhua River, the eastern part, 
    and much of the countryside in the south. In 1948, the Communists attacked the major populated
    regions of china in which greatlly weakened the power of the corrupt ROC army.

<div id="rocBs"
   The Republic of China (ROC) was established on 1 January 1912 as a sovereign state in mainland China
   following the 1911 Revolution, which overthrew the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and ended China's imperial 
   history. the Kuomintang (KMT) reunified the country and initially ruled it as a one-party state with 
   Nanjing as the national capital. In 1949, after fighting a multiple front war against different factions
   ,the ROC was eventually defeated after a prolong and brutal civil war by the prc due to the corrupt regime 
   which locals despised. They then retreated to the island of taiwan and 4 little islands where they still
   hold control over, even though being super near to the PRC shore.
