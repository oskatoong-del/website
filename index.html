    <h2>People’s Republic of China (PRC)</h2>
    <p>
      The PRC is the current ruling government of China with 22 provinces and the 23rd being Taiwan,
      333 province-level divisions, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, and 2 special administrative regions.
      Beijing is the capital, while Shanghai is the most populous city and largest financial center.
      Both were handed to the PRC
    by the british and the portugese respectively and will end their special administrative 
    status in 2047. It holds 17% of the world's population of 1.4 billion people. 
    </p>
    <h3>Mao Zedong's Rule</h3>
    <p>
      Formed in 1921, the CCP rose to power after defeating the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War.
      By 1949, the PRC was officially established, marking the beginning of communist rule in mainland China. 
      They took control of Jiangxi Province before moving north to Yan'an. This was after the nationalists 
      destroyed the old base. Being at yan'an, the communists then helped the nationalists fight
      the japanese before controlling all of Manchuria north of the Songhua River, the eastern part, 
      and much of the countryside in the south. In 1948, the Communists attacked the major populated
      regions of china in which greatlly weakened the power of the corrupt ROC army.

    <strong><h3>Capture of tibet + aksai chin = indian war machine:</h3></strong> After the chinese civil war,
    the <span style="color: blue;"><strong>PRC</strong></span> demanded that all former qing dynasty members
    are to join with the PRC. They did not have much attention to the mongolians as a buffer state for their 
    ally the soviets. However had a <strong>keen interest</strong> in tibet, this is due to its low population
    density in which decreases cost of maintaining tibet and helps gain more natural resources in the tibetian 
    plateau. <span style="color: red;"><strong>October 1950:</strong></span> Chinese steam rolls into the Chamdo
    region of eastern Tibet, defeating the Tibetan army in the Battle of Chamdo.

    May 23, 1951: Representatives of the Dalai Lama's government, under pressure from the Chinese military presence, 
    signed the <strong>Seventeen Point Agreement</strong> in Beijing, which formally affirmed China's sovereignty over Tibet.
    October 1951: The 14th Dalai Lama formally accepted the agreement. 
    <strong><h3>Sino soviet split first:</h3></strong> the gradual deterioration of relations between the Soviet Union
    and China from 1956 to 1966, driven by ideological differences and geopolitical tensions. Key issues included China's\
    rejection of Soviet de-Stalinization and "peaceful coexistence" with the West, which Mao Zedong saw as revisionism. 
    China also resented Soviet foreign policies, such as its relationship with India, while the USSR feared Mao's more aggressive stance.
    This ideological rift led to open conflict in 1969 and fundamentally altered the global balance of power during the Cold War. 
    Essentially, the split was due to the different ideologies and the desatlinization. This brought rise to the maoism which is a doctrine
    created by maozedong as formerly practised in China, having as a central idea permanent revolution and stressing the importance of the peasantry,
     small-scale industry, and agricultural collectivization. <strong>*of course now china does not practise it lah but its interesting :)</strong>
    </p>

    <strong><h3>Now the part you all have been waiting for.... the indian war machine!: (Sources from Sarah Paine but i elaborate)</h3></strong> 
    After the capture of <strong>tibet</strong>, India being super friendly recongizes the PRC as the one chinese government. India being super idealistic and 
    had allied the soviet union after the sino soviet split made china look at india with caution. So when china attacked tibet, indians were angry
    as tibetian culture was of indian origin and not chinese origin. So then the chinese stated that if india were to recognise their sovereignty
    over complete tibet and parts of the aksai chin in kashmir, china will recognise indian sovereignty over a much densely populated arunachal pradesh
    region. But Nehru does not agree with it, so during the cold war cuban missile crisis when soviets were distracted, they invades the aksai chin
     plateau and the arunachal pradesh area marking the 1960s sino indian war. The chinese won as the indians were furious, after treating the 
     chinese kindly even after the brutal oppression of tibet, so they bulk their military to become one of the most no.of active military personnels.
     <span style="color: yellow;"><strong>Jawaharlal nehru:</strong></span>"There are not many instances in history where one country has gone out of her way
     to be friendly and co-operative with the chinese government and people, and to plead their cause in the councils of the world, and then for the chinese even
     go tothe extent of commitig aggression and invade our sacred land. "

    <p>The Tang dynasty was one of China’s golden ages. <strong>Why would people say that?</strong> Well this is because of the Tang Dynasty's its cosmopolitan culture,
      political stability, and flourishing arts and sciences. The Tang dynasty was initially ruled by Emperor Gaozu (Li Yuan) and his son, Emperor Taizong (Li Shimin). 
      Emperor Gaozu founded the dynasty in 618 after overthrowing the Sui, and reigned until 626 when his son deposed him. Emperor Taizong then ruled from 626 to 
      649 and is credited with inaugurating the "Zhenguan Era," considered a peak of feudal society. </p>
    <p>
      <strong><h2>1.</h2><h3>Emperor Gaozu</h3></strong>: Emperor gaozu was the founder of the Tang dynasty. He was originally a senior minister of the previous Sui dynasty who rose 
      to power during its collapse. He was then crowned as emperor with his son <strong>Emperor TaiZhong</strong>. Emperor gaozu reigned from 618 to 626 during which his reign,
      Emperor gaozu defeated rival warlords, effectively trying to unify China under one empire. He adopted some laws and policies created by the first emperor of the Sui
      dynasty. He abolished the harsh laws and corrupt judicial system of the Sui Dynasty, lowered taxes, and implemented policies for the fair distribution of land,
      which helped stabilize the country and promote economic prosperity.
